<p align="center"># **Vision Statement**
 
## *What will the product do?*
	The product we plan to make is a turn-based strategy game, with missions
    controlled by a board-game like strategy layer. It takes inspiration 
    from similar games like X-COM: Enemy Unknown and Hand of Fate.

## *Why are you creating this particular project?*
    The purpose of this project is to create an interesting and engaging 
    video game of non-trivial scope.

## *Who will benefit from this project?*
    This game will benefit it’s players by allowing them to waste their 
    valuable leisure time. This project will also benefit it’s developers 
    by allowing them to grow and learn as software engineers.

## *How does the project compare to what is on the market?*
	The game we plan to create will be similar to largely successful 
	games on the market. It will take inspiration from games like X-COM 
	and Hand of Fate. The game will differ in it’s execution of the 
	strategic layer (that controls the narrative and flow of the game) and
	tactical layer (which is the turn-based combat system the player 
	interacts with).

# **Elevator Pitch:**

## *For:*
	Fans of turn-based strategy games and digital board games.

## *Who Benefits from this product:*
    Players benefit in the form of entertainment value. The developers 
    benefit from increased experience in game development.

## *The Product is:*
	A turn-based strategy game.

## *That Leads to:*
	Entertainment for the consumer, adding variety to a semi-stagnant 
    genre and a learning experience for the developers.

## *Unlike the competitors how:*
	Games are iterative by nature. It will take many of the lessons 
    learned from examining competitors’ games, and combining them in 
    new and interesting ways. Our strategy layer will draw inspiration 
    from board game mechanics, bringing in elements of luck and skill. 
    Our tactical layer will bring elements of decision making, risk 
    assessment, as well as a little bit of suffering luck.

For fans of turn-based strategy games and digital board games who 
have played games front to back in their game library and found 
themselves totally devoid of any interest in playing such games 
over again, the game we are creating will lead to another goddamn 
game in their Steam library that they get to play. Unlike our 
competitors such as X-Com and Hand of Fate, our game offers 
another fun experience in a different atmosphere.</p>
